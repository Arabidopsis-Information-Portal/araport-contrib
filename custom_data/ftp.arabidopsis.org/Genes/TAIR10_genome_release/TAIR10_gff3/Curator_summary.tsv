AT1G35710.1	
AT1G35720.1	Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants.

AT1G04400.1	Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation.

AT1G23260.1	MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

AT1G80360.1	Encodes a methionine-specific aminotransferase that uses the ethylene biosynthetic intermediate methionine as an  amino donor and the auxin biosynthetic intermediate indole-3-pyruvic acid as an amino acceptor to produce L-tryptophan  and 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid. These actions allow VAS1 to coordinate both auxin and ethylene biosynthesis.  It functions downstream of TAA1/SAV3 but upstream of YUCs to negatively modulate IAA biosynthesis directly by altering the 3-IPA pool.
AT1G80310.1	MOT2 encodes a molybdate transporter which locates to the vacuolar membrane.

AT1G73590.1	Encodes an auxin efflux carrier involved in shoot and root development. It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.

AT1G08880.1	Encodes HTA5, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10?20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

In Wassilewskija (Ws) accession: mutant alleles of RPT5a displayed 50% pollen lethality, indicating that RPT5a is essential for male gametophyte development. In the Columbia (Col) accession, a rpt5a mutant allele did not display such a phenotype because the RPT5b Col allele complements the rpt5a defect in the male gametophyte, whereas the RPT5b Ws allele does not. Double rpt5a rpt5b mutants in Col background showed a complete male and female gametophyte lethal phenotype.

Expression is found in all tissues examined, including meristems and floral organ primordium. Expression is particularly enhanced in pollen, and is repressed by light. Over expression and loss of function phenotypes suggest AVP1 is involved in regulation of apoplastic pH and auxin transport. The effect on auxin transport likely involves effects of extracellular pH on subcellular localization of auxin efflux carriers such as PIN1.

AT2G27250.1	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).

AT2G33860.1	ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF.

AT2G47530.1	
AT2G47460.1	"MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy. " The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.

AT3G12980.1	Encodes an enzyme with histone acetyltransferase activity that can use both H3 and H4 histones as substrates.  No  single prior lysine acetylation is sufficient to block HAC5 acetylation of the H3 or H4 peptides,  suggesting that HAC5 can acetylate any  of several lysines present in the peptides. Di-acetylation of  both lysines 9 and 14 on the H3 peptide significantly reduces  the level of incorporated radioactive acetylation catalyzed by  HAC5, indicating that HAC5 may acetylate either lysine 9 or  lysine 14.

TCTP is expressed throughout the plant with highest levels seen in meristematic regions of the shoot and root. Loss of function alleles are not transmitted through the male gametophyte due to defects in pollen tube growth. Hypomorphs, generated through RNAi, are dwarf and have smaller cells. These plants also have defects in lateral and primary root growth as well as root hair growth. The phenotypes are similar to TOR mutants suggesting that TCTP functions in the is pathway in Arabidopsis as well.

AT3G13170.1	Encodes AtSPO11-1, one of the three Arabidopsis homologues of the archaeal DNA topoisomerase VIA subunit (topo VIA).  Required for meiotic recombination.  AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2 have overlapping functions (i.e. both required for meiotic recombination) whereas AtSPO11-3 functions in DNA replication. AtSPO11-1 accumulates in foci in early G2. At 1 h post-S phase, no foci are observed, but by  3 h a majority (80%) of meiocytes at this time point  contain >50 foci. However, by 5 h, AtSPO11-1 foci are  no longer detectable. This suggests that the protein undergoes  a rapid cycle of accumulation and disappearance  in meiocytes over a period of between 1 and 5 h post-S  phase.

RIN4 physically interacts with RPS2 and RPM1 in vivo. Bacterial avirulence (Avr) effectors AvrB, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 induce a mobility shift in RIN4 and expression of AvrRpt2 induces rapid degradation of RIN4. RIN4 contains 2 sites for AvrRpt2 autocleavage, called RCS1 and RCS2. Overexpression of RIN4 inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function and also inhibits PAMP-induced defense signaling. Attached to the plasma membrane at its carboxyl terminus. Cleaved  by AvrRpt2 at two PxFGxW motifs, one releasing a large portion of RIN4 from the  plasma membrane and both exposing amino-terminal residues that destabilized the carboxyl-terminal cleavage products by targeting them for N-end ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation.

Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven.

AT3G30280.1	
AT3G04200.1	
AT3G04280.1	Encodes an atypical subtype of the ARR (Arabidopsis response regulator) protein family. ARR22 is more similar to the receiver domains of hybrid kinases than other response regulators. It acts as a phosphohistidine phosphatase when tested with phospho-AHP5 in vitro suggesting that it might be involved in a two-component phosphorelay. Expression of ARR22 transcripts appears to be localized to the chalaza and to be induced by wounding. Ectopic expression of ARR in other parts of the plant leads to reduced cytokinin-related responses and impaired root, shoot, and flower development. Overexpression of wild-type ARR22 in an arr22 mutant background causes variable defects in plant growth and fertility. But, in the same ar22 background, over-expression of versions of ARR22 that should act as dominant-negative or constitutively active proteins, based on mutations to the conserved Asp residue, do not show any phenotypic abnormalities, raising the possibility that these may not act as canonical response regulators.

AT3G10880.1	
AT3G10800.1	Encodes bZIP28, a putative membrane-tethered transcriptional factor. Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and shares a bZIP domain, transmembrane domain, and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment.

AT3G60370.1	Encodes an immunophilin, FKBP20-2, that belongs to the FK-506 binding protein (FKBP) subfamily functioning as peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) in protein folding. FKBP20-2 has a unique pair of cysteines at the C terminus and was found to be reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) (itself reduced by NADPH by means of NADP-Trx reductase). The FKBP20-2 protein, which contains only two of the five amino acids required for catalysis, showed a low level of PPIase activity that was unaffected on reduction by Trx.  Genetic disruption of the FKBP20-2 gene provide evidence that FKBP20-2 participates specifically in the accumulation of the PSII supercomplex in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen by means of a mechanism that has yet to be determined.

ROT3 was shown to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis, most likely in the conversion step of typhasterol (TY) to castasterone (CS). As 6-deoxo-CS was unable to restore the phenotype of rot3-1, it has been postulated that ROT3 might be specifically involved in the conversion of TY to CS in the C6-oxidation pathway of brassinolide. Recently, CYP90C1 was shown to catalyse the C-23 hydroxylation of several brassinosteroids (the enzyme has a broad specificity for 22-hydroxylated substrates).

AT4G32150.1	AtVAMP711 is a member of Synaptobrevin-like AtVAMP7C, v-SNARE (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) protein family. SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.

AT4G39400.1	Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.

AT4G16730.1	In the Col ecotype, no functional protein is encoded at this locus due to the presence of a two-base (AT) insertion 184 nucleotides  downstream of the start codon leading to a  frame shift and premature translational termination. However, in the Ws ecotype, a functional terpene synthase that localizes to the chloroplast is encoded at this locus. It can catalyze the synthesis of (E)-beta-ocimene and (E,E)-alpha farnesene in vitro, but, it has more activity as an (E)-beta-ocimene synthase activity in vivo. This may reflect the greater availability of the GPP precursor of (E)-beta-ocimene than of the FPP precursor of (E,E)-alpha-farnesene in the chloroplasts where the Ws TPS02 is present.

AT5G03150.1	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor with three zinc finger domains. jkd mutants show a number of root patterning defects including ectopic periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. jkd mutants also have a reduced number of meristematic cells in their roots. JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect.

AT5G58230.1	Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

AT5G57170.1	
AT5G57090.1	Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors.

AT5G56290.1	Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal "SKL" targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.

AT1G54690.1	Encodes HTA3, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10?20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

AT1G11400.1	The PYM gene encodes a protein capable of interacting with MAGO, and Y14, whose orthologs form part of the exon junction complex in animal cells. In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together.

AT1G21970.1	Transcriptional activator of genes required for both embryo maturation and cellular differentiation. Sequence is similar to HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box binding factor. HAP3 subunit is divided into three domains: an amino-terminal A domain, a central B domain, and a carboxyl-terminal C domain. LEC1 shared high similarity with other HAP3 homologs only in central, B domain. LEC1 is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. It was sufficient to induce embryogenic programs in vegetative cells, suggesting that LEC1 is a major embryonic regulator that mediates the switch between embryo and vegetative development. Mutants are desiccation intolerant, have trichomes on cotyledons and exhibit precocious meristem activation. Levels of the ABI3 and FUS3 transcripts were significantly reduced in developing siliques of the lec1-1 mutants, indicating that LEC1 down-regulates FUS3 and ABI3.When LEC1 is overexpressed from an inducible promoter, the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis is increased suggesting a role in positive regulation of FA biosynthesis.

Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. PINs are directly involved of in catalyzing  cellular auxin efflux.

AT1G11310.1	A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in  A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene,  jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin,  glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.

AT1G19270.1	
AT1G19180.1	JAZ1 is a nuclear-localized protein involved in jasmonate signaling. JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2.

AT2G17290.1	Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  CPK3 is also a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK family.

AT5G50700.1	Encodes a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD1.  Two copies of HSD1 (At5g50600 and At5g50700) exist in the Arabidopsis genome as a result of an exact 33-kb duplication on chromosome 5 encompassing seven genes.  There are five homologs of HSD1 in Arabidopsis (HSD2-At3g47350, HSD3-At3g47360, HSD4-At5g50590, HSD4-At5g50690 and HSD6-At5g50770; HSD4 has two copies due to the same gene duplication event occurred to HSD1) (Plant Cell Physiology 50:1463). At5g50690 is also named as HSD7 (Plant Physiology 145:87).  HSD1 is identified from the proteome of oil bodies from mature seeds.  Transcription of HSD1 is specifically and highly induced in oil-accumulating tissues of mature seeds; transcript disappears during germination.

AT3G16770.1	Encodes a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-2 of the plant specific ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (RAP2.3).  The protein contains one AP2 domain. There are 5 members in this subfamily including RAP2.2 AND RAP2.12.It is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator through the GCC-box. It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6.   It is part of the ethylene signaling pathway and is predicted to act downstream of EIN2 and CTR1, but not under EIN3.
ATSRP30.1	Encodes a serine-arginine rich RNA binding protein involved in regulation of splicing (including splicing of itself). Exists as 3 alternative spliced forms that are differentially expressed.

They form two functionally non-redundant groups essential for the normal elongation of glucuronoxylan backbone. I9H functions redundantly with IRX9, I14H is redundant with IRX14.  IRX9 or I9H do not complement IRX14, IRX14 or I14H do not complement IRX9.

AT1G27580.1	
AT1G27650.1	U2 auxiliary factor small subunit. The atU2AF35a protein and its homolog, atU2AF35b, contain most of the conserved domains of hsU2AF35, including the psiRRM, one RS domain, two zinc fingers, and the two regions for interacting with U2AF large subunit. Both proteins lack the stretch of glycines present in human U2AF35. The sequences are overall 83% identical, and each Arabidopsis homolog shows approximately 70% similarity to hsU2AF35.    U2AF(35) homologs were also identified from maize, rice and other plants with large-scale EST projects. Both genes are expressed in all major tissues, with atU2AF(35)a expressed at a higher level than atU2AF(35)b in most tissues. The expression patterns were different in roots: atU2AF(35)b expressed strongly in whole young roots and root tips and atU2AF(35)a limited to root vascular regions.
AT1G27640.1	Putative role in leaf development.  Comparison of SALK_123839C to Columbia under normal growth conditions resulted in a trend toward increased leaf length in the mutant (P=0.13; median 22 for mutant,17 for Columbia) (Ann Stapleton and Delita Pardue, 2009, personal communication).

Salicylic acid can decrease this enzyme's activity in vitro and may act as a competitive inhibitor. Expression of PBS3/GH3.12 can be detected in cotyledons, true leaves, hypocotyls, and occasionally in some parts of roots from 10-day-old seedlings.  No expression has been detected in root, stem, rosette or cauline leaves of mature 4- to 5-week-old plants.
AT5G37760.1	
AT5G37770.1	Encodes a protein with 40% similarity to calmodulin. Binds Ca(2+) and, as a consequence, undergoes conformational changes. CML24 expression occurs in all major organs, and transcript levels are increased from 2- to 15-fold in  plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat,  cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid  (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid. However, CML24 protein accumulation changes were not  detectable. The putative CML24 regulatory region confers reporter expression at sites  of predicted mechanical stress; in regions undergoing growth; in vascular tissues and  various floral organs; and in stomata, trichomes, and hydathodes. CML24-underexpressing transgenics are resistant to ABA inhibition of germination and seedling growth, are defective in long-day induction of flowering, and have enhanced tolerance to CoCl(2), molybdic acid, ZnSO(4), and MgCl(2).  Also regulates nitric oxide levels.

AT3G60190.1	At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central ?dynamin 2? domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.

AT3G52560.1	MMZ4/UEV1D encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1D can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ4/UEV1D transcripts are found in most plant organs, like the other three MMZ/UEV1 family members, but it is normally present at higher levels. In addition, MMZ4/UEV1D is the only family member whose transcripts are detected in pollen. However, MMZ4/UEV1D transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. uev1d-1 mutants are more sensitive than wild type plants to the DNA damaging agent MMS in seed germination and pollen germination assays.

AT3G54390.1	
AT3G54610.1	Encodes a histone acetyltransferase that is plays a role in the determination of the embryonic root-shoot axis.  It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG.  In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been  previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.

Members of this family include: At5g60810 (RGF1), At1g13620 (RGF2), At2g04025 (RGF3), At3g30350 (RGF4), At5g51451 (RGF5), At4g16515 (RGF6), At3g02240 (RGF7), At2g03830 (RGF8) and At5g64770 (RGF9).
AT4G16143.1	Protein interacts with Agrobacterium proteins VirD2 and VirE2. Is not individually essential for Agrobacterium-mediated root transformation, but when overexpressed can rescue the impa-4 decreased transformation susceptibility phenotype.
AT4G16566.1	Encodes a protein that has an unexpected bifunctional capability in vitro. The purified enzyme has  adenylylsulfate sulfohydrolase activity (E.C. 3.6.2.1) and ADP-sulfurylase activity (E.C. 2.7.7.5). The latter is activated at low pH. The enzyme can exert it phosphorylase activity on a range of related substrates in vitro, but it acts best with APS (adenosine 5'-phsophosulfate). This protein appears to function as a homodimer.

AT4G14695.1	
AT4G14713.1	PPD1 (and its paralog, PPD2) encode plant-specific putative DNA-binding proteins. PPD1 and PPD2 are not found in grasses. Overexpression of PPD reduces lamina size by promoting the early arrest of dispersed meristematic cells DMC proliferation during leaf and silique development. Deletion of the PPD locus increases leaf lamina size and results in dome-shaped rather than flat leaves. Siliques are also altered in shape because of extra lamina growth. The curvature of a deltappd leaf reflects the difference between excess growth of the lamina and a limitation to the extension capacity of its perimeter.

AT5G64813.1	The LIP1 gene encodes a small GTPase that influences the light input pathway of the plant circadian network. An MBP:LIP1 fusion protein has GTP hydrolyzing abilities in vitro. In plants, LIP1 seems to play a negative role in regulating circadian period that can be suppressed by light. LIP1 also seems to negatively affect light-pulse-dependent resetting of the clock, especially during the first portion of the subjective evening. LIP1 expression levels are not significantly affected by the circadian clock in seedlings grown under LL conditions. The levels of the YFP:LIP1 protein expressed under the control of the 35S promoter, shows a low amplitude variation, with protein levels peaking near the beginning of subjective night under LL conditions. In hypocotyl epidermal cells of dark and light-grown seedlings, a YFP:LIP1 fusion protein can be seen in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and does not cluster in nuclear speckles. LIP1 may also be involved in photomorphogenesis.

AT4G33495.1	A member of the RPD gene family - there are13 annotated genes and one EST encoding RPD1-like proteins in Arabidopsis. Shows no homology to any protein of known function. Abundant expression found in the shoot apex and the root. rpd1 mutant is a temperature-sensitive mutant isolated on the basis of the impairment in adventitious roots formation in hypocotyl region. Also, disruption of the RPD1 gene by a T-DNA insertion caused embryogenesis arrest at the globular to transition stages. This phenotype is consistent with the hypothesized function of RPD1 in the maintenance of active cell proliferation.

AT3G63530.1	Encodes a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts as a central negative regulator of Arabidopsis floral organ size.  Organ size is limited by restricting the period of proliferative growth, rather than the rate of growth and appears to act in a novel pathway, independent of ANT and JAG. Both mRNA and protein are expressed in all actively growing regions of the plant and the vasculature and the protein is rapidly turned over by proteasome-mediated degradation.

GPA1 (in its GTP-bound state) affects the GTP binding and GTPase activity of GTG2 and may act to down-regulate GTG2 binding to ABA. GTG2 is widely expressed throughout the plant and appears to be involved in the regulation of several ABA-dependent responses including seed germination, plant development, and promotion of stomatal closure. GTG2 transcript levels do not appear to change in response to ABA or abiotic stresses.

AT3G06665.1	
AT3G60590.2	
AT3G10770.2	
AT3G04280.2	Encodes an atypical subtype of the ARR (Arabidopsis response regulator) protein family. ARR22 is more similar to the receiver domains of hybrid kinases than other response regulators. It acts as a phosphohistidine phosphatase when tested with phospho-AHP5 in vitro suggesting that it might be involved in a two-component phosphorelay. Expression of ARR22 transcripts appears to be localized to the chalaza and to be induced by wounding. Ectopic expression of ARR in other parts of the plant leads to reduced cytokinin-related responses and impaired root, shoot, and flower development. Overexpression of wild-type ARR22 in an arr22 mutant background causes variable defects in plant growth and fertility. But, in the same ar22 background, over-expression of versions of ARR22 that should act as dominant-negative or constitutively active proteins, based on mutations to the conserved Asp residue, do not show any phenotypic abnormalities, raising the possibility that these may not act as canonical response regulators.

AT3G47450.2	Encodes a protein with similarity to the bacterial YqeH GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. In Arabidopsis, mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling in plants. It also attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence and cell death. This gene product is also involved in nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.

AT2G29650.2	Encodes an inorganic phosphate transporter that  is localized to the thylakoid membrane.
AT2G29630.2	Encodes a protein involved in thiamin biosynthesis. The protein is an iron-sulfur cluster protein predicted to catalyze the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) or  hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. A conserved TPP-binding site is located in the 3' UTR of the At2g29630.2 gene model, and is predicted to function as a riboswitch. The riboswitch controls the  formation of transcripts with alternative 3' UTR lengths, which affect mRNA accumulation and protein production. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.  Recessive mutant isolated by Redei. Leaves but not cotyledons white, lethal; restored to normal by thiamine or 2,5-dimethyl-4-aminopyrimidine.

AT1G04320.1	
AT1G04400.2	Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.

AT2G27250.2	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).

In vrn2 mutants, FLC expression is downregulated normally in response to vernalization, but instead of remaining low, FLC mRNA levels increase when plants are returned to normal temperatures. VRN2 maintains FLC repression after a cold treatment, serving as a mechanism for the cellular memory of vernalization. Required for complete repression of FLC. Required for the methylation of histone H3

AT4G14713.2	PPD1 (and its paralog, PPD2) encode plant-specific putative DNA-binding proteins. PPD1 and PPD2 are not found in grasses. Overexpression of PPD reduces lamina size by promoting the early arrest of dispersed meristematic cells DMC proliferation during leaf and silique development. Deletion of the PPD locus increases leaf lamina size and results in dome-shaped rather than flat leaves. Siliques are also altered in shape because of extra lamina growth. The curvature of a deltappd leaf reflects the difference between excess growth of the lamina and a limitation to the extension capacity of its perimeter.

Arabidopsis genome has two ADC paralogs, ADC1 and ADC2. ADC2 is stress-inducible (osmotic stress). Double mutant analysis showed that ADC genes are essential for the production of PA, and are required for normal seed development. Overexpression causes phenotypes similar to GA-deficient plants and these plants show reduced levels of GA due to lower expression levels of AtGA20ox1, AtGA3ox3 and AtGA3ox1.
AT4G34460.3	Encodes the heterotrimeric G-protein beta subunit and is involved in organ shape. A significant fraction of the protein is found in the ER.  Mutants carrying null alleles express similar fruit phenotypes, as seen in er plants, but differ from er in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the pedicel is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are rounder than those in er mutants. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level found in siliques. It is involved in resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The predicted protein has two DWD motifs. It can bind to DDB1a in Y2H assays and may be involved in the formation of a CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase.  It seems to be involved in the calcium-mediated response to extracellular ATP.

AT4G23470.3	
AT4G23570.3	Closely related to SGT1B, may function in SCF(TIR1) mediated protein degradation. AtSGT1a and AtSGT1b are functionally redundant in the resistance to pathogenes. AtSGT1b was more highly  expressed than AtSGT1. The N-terminal TPR domain of  AtSGT1a reduces the steady-state level of Arabidopsis SGT1  proteins whereas the same domain from AtSGT1b enhances  SGT1 accumulation. The TPR domain is dispensable for SGT1 resistance. AtSGT1a is induced upon pathogen infection and can function in R gene-mediated resistance.

AT4G29540.2	Encodes a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase.
AT4G35090.2	Encodes a peroxisomal catalase, highly expressed in bolts and leaves.  mRNA expression patterns show circadian regulation with mRNA levels being high in the subjective early morning. Loss of function mutations have increased H2O2 levels and increased H2O2  sensitivity. Mutants accumulate more toxic ions yet show decreased sensitivity to Li+. This decreased sensitivity is most likely due to an insensitivity to ethylene.  Note that in Queval et al. (2007) Plant Journal, 52(4):640, SALK_057998 is named as cat2-1, SALK_076998 is named as cat2-2; in Bueso et al. (2007) Plant Journal, 52(6):1052, SALK_076998 is named as cat2-1. TAIR has adopted the nomenclature consistent with that in Bueso et al. (2007) after consultation with the authors: SALK_076998 (cat2-1), SALK_057998 (cat2-2).

This enzyme can also catalyze the formation of (E)-beta-ocimene as well as trace amounts of myrcene and other related compounds in vitro. The cytosolic localization of the protein may make it favor (E,E)-alpha-farnesene biosynthesis because the precursor of this product, FPP, is primarily cytosolic. Transcript levels for this gene increase in response to treatment with the jasmonic acid mimic coronalon or in response to the insect <i>Plutella xylostella</i>. TPS03 transcripts can also be detected in flowers. A similar protein from the C24 ecotype with one amino acid change (S267F) has a different substrate specificity.

Constitutive expression of WRKY18  enhanced resistance to P. syringae, but its coexpression with WRKY40 or WRKY60 made plants more susceptible to both  P. syringae and B. cinerea. WRKY18, WRKY40, and WRKY60 have partially redundant roles in response to the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, with WRKY18 playing a more important role than the other two.

AT4G21750.2	Encodes a homeobox protein similar to GL2. It is expressed in both the apical and basal daughter cells of the zygote as well as their progeny.  Expression is detected starting the two-celled stage of embryo development and is later restricted to the outermost, epidermal cell layer from its inception. Its promoter is highly modular with each region contributing to specific aspects of the gene's spatial and temporal expression.  Double mutant analysis with PDF2, another L1-specific gene, suggests that their functions are partially redundant and the absence of both of the genes result in abnormal shoot development.

It also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. CaM does not interfere with PCaP1 membrane localization but does weaken interactions between it and the PtdInsPs. PCaP1 has an apparent Kd of 10 uM for Cu2+ and can bind six ions per protein. Transcript levels for PCaP1 first fall and then rise following exposure to CuCl2. Mannitol, sorbitol, and the flg22 oligopeptide also increase expression levels.

MicroRNAs can negatively regulate gene expression by attenuating translation or by directing mRNA cleavage. Mature sequence: UCGCUUGGUGCAGGUCGGGAA.  MIR168a is highly expressed and predominantly produces a 21-nt miR168 species. By contrast, MIR168b is expressed at low levels and produces an equal amount of 21- and 22-nt miR168 species.

Expressed in cotyledons and leaves. Mutants display de-etiolation and derepression of light-induced genes in the dark, dwarfism, male sterility and activation of stress-regulated genes in the light. The expression of the gene using a CPD promoter:LUC fusion construct was shown to be under circadian and light control. Additionally, the circadian regulation was shown to be independent of BR levels as it remains unchanged in <i>bri1</i> mutant lines. CPD appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through a BRI1-mediated signaling pathway that affects FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses.

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO11 belongs to the clade I, with AtMLO4 and AtMLO14. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth (in primary root), in root tips and lateral root primordia, and in very young leaves, and in flowers and fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

Abundance increased by auxin through stabilization of the protein. Elevates CDK levels and activity, even under hormone-free conditions. Promotes cell division and shortens cell doubling time, inhibits cell growth. Transgenic plants overexpressing AtE2Fa contained an increased level of AtE2Fb transcripts that is paralleled by an increase in the amount of the AtE2Fb protein, suggesting that AtE2Fb expression might actually be up-regulated by the AtE2Fa transcription factor.

MIR168a is highly expressed and predominantly produces a 21-nt miR168 species. By contrast, MIR168b is expressed at low levels and produces an equal amount of 21- and 22-nt miR168 species. Only the 21-nt miR168 is preferentially stabilized by AGO1, and consequently, the accumulation of the 22-nt but not the 21-nt miR168 is reduced when DCL1 activity is impaired. mir168a mutants with strongly reduced levels of 21-nt miR168 are viable but exhibit developmental defects, particularly during environmentally challenging conditions.

AT1G29071.1	predicted to encode a C/D box type of snoRNA, also known as Ath-282 (GB:AJ505633). But, the submitted sequence of 106 nucleotides is only part of the 162 nucleotide sequence predicted by Northern blotting. It is assumed that a 5' portion of the gene is missing and its 5' end has not been conclusively mapped. Sequence analysis of this snoRNA suggests that it may not function like other C/D box family members that modify rRNAs or snRNAs. Its true biological target remains unknown. The promoter of this snoRNA has hallmarks of the snRNA promoters targeted by RNA polymerase II,  indicating that it might also have a TMG (2,2,7 trimethyguanosine) cap. SnoRNA105 may also play a novel role in ribosome biogenesis (Marker 2002). Northern blotting reveals that snoRNA105 expression levels are higher in seedlings than in adult plants.

AT1G50240.2	The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, which we named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.

AT3G03702.1	Potential natural antisense gene, locus overlaps with AT3G03700
AT3G04280.3	Encodes an atypical subtype of the ARR (Arabidopsis response regulator) protein family. ARR22 is more similar to the receiver domains of hybrid kinases than other response regulators. It acts as a phosphohistidine phosphatase when tested with phospho-AHP5 in vitro suggesting that it might be involved in a two-component phosphorelay. Expression of ARR22 transcripts appears to be localized to the chalaza and to be induced by wounding. Ectopic expression of ARR in other parts of the plant leads to reduced cytokinin-related responses and impaired root, shoot, and flower development. Overexpression of wild-type ARR22 in an arr22 mutant background causes variable defects in plant growth and fertility. But, in the same ar22 background, over-expression of versions of ARR22 that should act as dominant-negative or constitutively active proteins, based on mutations to the conserved Asp residue, do not show any phenotypic abnormalities, raising the possibility that these may not act as canonical response regulators.

It may preferentially demethylate H3mK9 at low-copy loci to protect them from silencing by nearby heterochromatin by preventing the spread of cytosine methylation. BONSAI (At1g73177) is hypermethylated in ibm1 mutants. ibm1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. These phenotypes cannot result solely from the BONSAI hypermethylation. Aberrant phenotypes in ibm1 mutants in both DNA methylation and plant development can be suppressed by mutations in the KYP H3K9 methyltransferase or he CMT3 non CG-cytosine methylase.

AT3G52560.3	MMZ4/UEV1D encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1D can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ4/UEV1D transcripts are found in most plant organs, like the other three MMZ/UEV1 family members, but it is normally present at higher levels. In addition, MMZ4/UEV1D is the only family member whose transcripts are detected in pollen. However, MMZ4/UEV1D transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. uev1d-1 mutants are more sensitive than wild type plants to the DNA damaging agent MMS in seed germination and pollen germination assays.

AT2G27229.1	
AT2G27250.3	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).

AT1G72530.2	
AT1G72970.2	Originally identified as a mutation that causes floral organs to fuse together. About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.

AT1G70660.2	MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.

AT5G62165.4	Encodes a MADS box transcription factor. Expressed in quiescent center. Involved in floral transition.
AT5G62165.5	Encodes a MADS box transcription factor. Expressed in quiescent center. Involved in floral transition.
AT5G62230.2	Encodes a receptor-like kinase that, together with ER and ERL2 governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. It is important for maintaining stomatal stem cell activity and preventing terminal differentiation of the meristemoid into the guard mother cell. Along with erl2 functionally compensates for loss of erecta during integument development.

AT5G62790.2	1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) catalyzes the first committed step of the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis, DXR is encoded by a single-copy gene. Arabidopsis  DXR is targeted to plastids and localizes into chloroplasts of leaf cells. DXR knockout or strongly silenced lines have a seedling lethal, albino phenotype. Transgenic, partially silenced lines expressing 35S:DXR have a variegated phenotype.

AT5G64390.3	encodes a K homology (KH) domain-containing, putative RNA binding protein that interacts with HUA1, a CCCH zinc finger RNA binding protein in the nucleus. HEN4 acts redundantly with HUA1 and HUA2 in the specification of floral organ identity in the third whorl.
AT5G64460.8	
AT5G64470.3	Encodes a member of the TBL (TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE) gene family containing a plant-specific DUF231 (domain of unknown function) domain. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).
AT5G64910.2	
AT5G64990.2	
AT5G65070.3	Encodes MADS-box containing FLC paralog. Five splice variants have been identified but not characterized with respect to expression patterns and/or differing function. Overexpression of the gene in the Landsberg ecotype leads to a delay in flowering, transcript levels of MAF4 are reduced after a 6 week vernalization.
AT5G65240.2	
AT5G65420.2	Encodes a D-type cyclin CYCD4;1 that physically interacts with CDC2A and is expressed during vascular tissue development, embryogenesis, and formation of lateral root primordia. Its expression is upregulated early during germination.Involved in stomatal cell lineage proliferation in the hypocotyl.
AT5G65420.3	Encodes a D-type cyclin CYCD4;1 that physically interacts with CDC2A and is expressed during vascular tissue development, embryogenesis, and formation of lateral root primordia. Its expression is upregulated early during germination.Involved in stomatal cell lineage proliferation in the hypocotyl.
AT5G65430.3	member of 14-3-3 proteins. This protein is reported to interact with the BZR1 transcription factor involved in brassinosteroid signaling and may affect the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of BZR1
AT5G65440.3	
AT5G65685.2	
AT5G65700.2	Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.
