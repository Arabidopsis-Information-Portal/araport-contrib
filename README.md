Data files (and scripts used to generate these files) for the AIP Intermine, JBrowse and GBrowse2 installations

Shell scripts used to generate the data files rely on the following github repository: [tanghaibao/jcvi](https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi>).
Within this repository, the [formats/gff.py](https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/blob/master/formats/gff.py) module is the most heavily used, which contains a wide variety of GFF manipulation scripts.
